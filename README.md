# Pliers Mod for Milking Chickens in Minecraft

## Story
As everyone knows, parents never lie. Parents cannot lie.

Our son went through a Minecraft phase. One summer day, after a long series of Minecraft stories and trivia (which he read about thoroughly), my beloved wife asked:

- "Do you know about chicken-milking pliers?"
- "Chicken-milking pliers?! (WOW)"
- "You craft them almost the same way as shears, and when you use them on a chicken, 3-5 eggs pop out."

Parents cannot lie. I couldn't resist ensuring our son told everyone at school about the chicken-milking pliers. This mod was born from that inspiration.

Surely, if I had used Forge, I would have done this much faster and more efficiently (since Forge makes adding new items easier), but our server was already running on Bukkit.

## Features
- **Custom Item:** Chicken-milking pliers crafted similarly to shears.
- **Crafting Recipe:**
  - Shape:
    ```
    I  
    II
    ```
  - Where `I` is an iron ingot.
- **Entity Interactions:**
  - **Chickens:** Drop 3-5 eggs.
  - **Cows:** Drop leather.
  - **Sheep:** Drop cookies.
  - **Pigs:** Drop carrots, potatoes, and beets.

  - **Donkeys:** Drop chests.
  - **Llamas:** Drop white carpets.
  - **Zombies:** Drop rotten flesh and sometimes an iron sword.
